    <h2>[Matthew Cross]</h2>
    <p> I attended Campion College for 7 years where I also played on the cricket team. Now, I am currently reading for a degree in Computer Science, realizing my love for technology and innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic. With my main focus being in the Cyber-security and networking fields, I wanted to investigate the Web Development world to see what it as all about creating functional websites.I was also not particularly good with HTML so I would like to better my skills.</p>
